Summary: A short list of a few of my major gripes with Windows 10
Status: Draft

#### Windows Update
This one is a big one for me. Windows users with a Pro license may not realize that if you are not a Pro user, you cannot indefinitely delay updates.
Of course as a developer I understand Microsofts insistance on timely updates, but at the end of the day I don't accept that there isn't even the possibility, regardless of effort required, to bypass updating.
Another major gripe of mine in terms of updates, is waking the computer from sleep. I can't count how many times I have woken up to find my pc sitting on the login screen.


#### Windows Search
Compared to the search capabilities of Linux, OSX, or even Windows 7, searching for files and folders has never been more frustrating than with Windows 10.
I made many different attempts at improving the search function, everything from a clean install to activating Cortana, to indexing all of the folders multiple times. Unfortunately, the search never managed to consistantly find what I was looking for.
A smaller issue, more about the UI of the search function, is with the 'up directory' button. Normally when clicked this button will move you into the parent directory of the one you are in. But when you are in a folder found using search, it only brings you back to the search pan. Isn't that what the back button is for? Why do I have to go through extra steps to reach the parent directory of a found folder, instead of using a button that does that function in every other circumstance?

#### Native Apps
I won't complain too much about the bloatware that is now standard on a fresh Windows 10 install, but one of my largest pet peeves about 10 is with its photos application. If you open a picture from a folder that contains other pictures, you would expect the basic shortcuts to work. The most egregious offence in my opinion is that the back/forward buttons on a mouse do absolutely nothing. Microsoft has instead moved that functionality to the scroll wheel, which would normally be used for zooming in on a photo. 

#### Pushing Windows Store
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the competition in the market to provide easy access to programs and media.
