Summary: Google IO included talk of Android N, Google Assistant, two new services Allo and Duo and much more.

Google IO (Input/Output) is one of the major tech events that happens each year. 2016 marks the 10th anniversary of the presentation.
While I expected some more fanfare for the 10th (and it certainly debut with a high energy musical/video performance), it was nice to see a somewhat relaxed and calmer keynote.

Some companies host events like this for the press, others have booths at consumer events, but google's audience at IO consists of press, consumers and a large selection of developers.
Having developement experience isn't mandatory to attend any of the lecturs, but it certainly helps when discussing the intricate details of new APIs or programs.
Even though my main programming language is Python, I know enough Java to follow along with the developer talks. These talks are a boon of tips and tricks to using some to the new APIs.

In the order from the keynote presentation, Google introduced Google Assistant, and I have to say that my mind leapt to a comparison with the old Microsoft Clippy.
Presenting the Google Assistant was Mario Querioz. Even though Google Assistant is a software implementation, one of the main implementations is with a device named Google Home.
At the start of the segment Mr.Querioz alluded to other companies with similar products on the market. When revealed, it is obvious the Google Home device takes inspiration from the Amazon Echo(ToDo: Source)
