* Zim-Wiki

  Zim-wiki is a useful tool for managing notes. Originally I had been using a random assortment of text files to take notes. This worked up to a certain point, but I found the organization to be difficult and mapping connections more frustrating than it should have been.

  After suffering from a small data loss, I moved from a manual backup system of text files to using [[https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki][vim-wiki]] to take notes and git version control for saving.

  This system worked for a while, but I found that where monospaced fonts worked for some notes, I generally prefered to read my notes in a more traditional gui setting. Additionally, I found that while gVim works in Windows, it is somewhat out of place with the rest of my workflow.

  Here is where Zim comes in. It has a nice, simplistic interface and is quite easy to setup and use. Additionally it is cross-platform and behaves identically in linux and Windows.

  The only downside that I have found is that there is currently no working mobile counterpart for Android or iOS.

  Zim-wiki notes can be done in Markdown, which makes styling straightforward.

  Installation is also fairly easy, with either `apt-get install zim` if on linux or from [[http://www.glump.net/software/zim-windows][here]] in either portable or desktop versions.

  If you would like to see my notes, here are some screenshots, and you see anything interesting, grab a copy at my [[https://github.com/NathanMH/notes][github]].
