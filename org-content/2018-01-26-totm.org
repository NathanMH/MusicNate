* Org-Mode

  I imagine that the majority of people who have put in the time to learn Emacs properly already make use of Org-Mode, but if you are just venturing into the world of classic editors then it might be the deciding factor.

  When I was using vim I longed for a unified method of tagging items, managing my todo list and organizing my personal wiki.

  The wiki was what pushed me to migrate back to Emacs, and with the continued development of Evil (Vim keybindings in Emacs), it seemed like the best of both worlds.

  There are so many organization and mind mapping tools that it can be overwhelming.
